# Command-Line-Interface
School assignment for my operating system paper. <br />
We had to implement our own CD command and then use a system call to execute the command executables. <br />
With this program you can chain together commands with pipes and also redirect output to a file.  <br />
Full marks were achieved in this assignment.
